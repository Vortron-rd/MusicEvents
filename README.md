<sup>* Polling order here means that the mod will check for conditions in the order specified above. it will first check for jukeboxes, then bosses, ect.

- **Ambient Mode!** Want to use sound effects or ambient tracks instead of music? Enable ambient mode to add to vanilla music instead of replacing it!

## How to use:
### 1. Set up the music folder.
The mod will take .ogg and .mp3 sound files from the folder called "music". This folder is located in the minecraft instance path (the same folder where your clients mods, resource packs and config folders are located.) which is usually your .minecraft directory, but can be in a different directory depending on if you are using another launcher like CurseForge. If this folder does not exist it will be created by the mod upon first startup. If you are a modpack developer that wants to use this mod you will have to mark this folder for export. Once you have created the folder or once the mod has created the folder for you, you can put any .ogg or .mp3 sound files you need in the folder.

<br><sup>Put the .ogg or .mp3 files in the music folder. Make sure they are .ogg or .mp3 files!

### 2. Set up the config.
While it is possible to use the config file to set up the mod, it is recommended to use the Forge in-game config menu in the Forge mod list.

### 3. Set up the music.
By default most features are disabled. This is because while leaving enabled features empty does not impact performance too much, they do still use some resources in the background. At the top of the config menu there will be a list called "Available Music Files", this can be used to see what sound files in the biomemusic folder are recognized and can be used. For all music except boss music and the main menu music, you can specify more then one track by seperating them with a comma e.g. [song1.ogg,song2.ogg]. If ambient Mode is enabled custom music will not fade out and stop vanilla music. [The Biome Music Mapping] is used to specify custom music for individual biomes, this will overwrite the music set for tags of the biome. Setting music for a biome tag in the [Biome Tag Music Mapping] will play this music in all biomes with that tag. If a biome has more than one tag, a random song from any tag will play with slight priority set in the biomes tag order. For example, if you set up two music tracks for the dry and the savanna tags, it one of them randomly when you enter a savanna, but will more often choose a song from the savanna tag then from the dry tag, because savanna is the first tag for the savanna biome. If a custom song is already playing and you enter a new biome the song will not change if the song is specified in one of the tags for that biome, unless you specify a different song in the [Biome Music Mapping].

   For **Boss Music**, There is an option to set the detection range for bosses. If a boss is detected within that radius the music will change if the mob is specified as a boss mob. To set up the music for a boss mob there is the [Boss Music List]. For each boss mob you want to set up music for, create a new line and specify the mob and the music seperated by a comma: [modid:mobid,bossmusic1.ogg]. Keep in mind to not forget the Mod Id from the mob! (e.g. [lycanitesmobs:rahovart,bossmusic1.ogg]). The Boss Music has priority based on the index of the list. It will always try to play the muscic for the boss mob it can find first in the list. So if you have both the wither and the Ender Dragon in the list and you spawn in both of them, it will play the music from whichever mob is first in the list.

   For **Combat Music**, you can set the range in which it tries to look for aggro'd mobs, the amount of aggro'd mobs you need to start the combat music, and the amount of mobs that need to be left to stop the combat music. In The [Combat Music List] you can set general combat soundtracks, If there is no Linked SoundTrack specified in the [musiclink] option a random song from here will play when combat music engages.

   **MusicLink**. This option is used if you have two of the same soundstracks of which one is a combat track. To use this, look for the normal track in the list, and as the input give the combat variant of that track. This will make it so that if the music is playing it will always play the combat version of the track when combat music engages. If there is no musiclink specified, it will play a random song from the [Combat Music List] in the combat options.

   For **Cavern Music** you are able to set the starting Y level at which cavern music starts, and the Y level at which it stops. Please keep in mind to place the stop Y level sufficiently above the Start Y level as to not fade-in and fade-out the music all too much. You can set what cavern music you want in the [Cavern Music List:].

   **Fade Options** is the last part of the config. I cannot stress this enough, **If you do not know what you are doing, do not change these options.** Changing these option to bad values can and will break the mod. 
The fade-in and fade-out options control how fast or slow music fades in or out when changing, while you can set these to different values to customize the mod to your liking, please do not set them to excessively low or high values.
The [Polling Rate] option is the heart of the mod. every action the mod takes is controlled by the polling rate, which acts as a sort of timer. Increasing the polling rate value slow down how fast the mod reacts to changes and the other way around. In general it is recommended to only try higher values for a slower and less intrusive experience if you find that the music still changes too fast even after first setting up the rest of the mod completely.


## Disclaimer
- While the mod does work with *most* Modded entities and biomes, some might not work. The mod was tested with mods like DefiledLands and Lycanites, But some mobs from other mods with which the mod was not tested might not be compatible. Similarly for some custom biomes from other mods, they might not be recognized. Even if the mod does not recognize a biome, as long as they either have parent biomes or biome tags, the music set using biome tags will work.

- Please do not forget to add the .ogg to the sound files when setting up music. Without .ogg behind the file name it will not work!
- Please do not forget to set values back to "default_music" when you want to disable something. It might break certain functions if left empty.

- Yes, I will probably update this mod to later versions of minecraft if I have time or if the mod gains a lot of traction.
